# trackGenerator
Drone racing track generator based on python, math and telegram bot

Trying to implement automatic generation of a drone racing track using python.
The idea is that first of all we get number of gates and flags. Then we have a function f(x,y) = hardness of track, which is equal to the sum of elements multiplyed
by their hardness coeficcients and we need to optimize the f(x,y) the way we get the requested hardness and used maximum number of gates and flags we have. 

The generation part is still to be created...
